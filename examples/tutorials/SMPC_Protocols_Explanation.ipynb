    "# SMPC Protocols Explanation \n",
    "This notebook will give you an overview and a very quick explanation of/over the different SMPC protocols that are currently implemented in PySyft. It'll also elaborate on **what kind of Machine Learning you can conduct in an encrypted fashion using them**, along with a comparison of their resulting performance to each other and to the non-encrypted scenario. The protocol explanations should mainly serve to give you a high-level understanding of what the main **crypto-slang** stands for, how the terms relate to each other and what resources serve as good starting points to dig deeper! \n",

    "## Quick recap - What is SMPC encryption?\n",
    "As a quick recap, \"SMPC\" stands for **Secure Multi-Party Computation** and constitutes a form of encryption that can be used for Machine Learning (i.e. it is possible to do calculations on encrypted data) leveraging a network of min. 2 different servers. These systems are typically resistant to some level of **collusion.** This means that usually it is considered that there exists a *honest majority* of servers which are trusted of not collaborating with each other. As a whole the servers work as a **trusted execution environment** on which sensitive calculations such as model inference, training, etc. can be done without the model or the data being disclosed to any party besides the respective owner. \n",
    "\n",
    "## General concepts \n",
    "* Important concepts that all protocols are based upon - *in brief:* \n",
    "  * **A Public value,** is considered data (e.g. input from the data-sources) which is known by all parties. \n",
    "  * **A Private value,** is considered data which is secured through additive secret sharing, only the owner knows the true value. \n",
    "  * **Masking:** To share a private value publicly (e.g. as a necessary part in a protocol) it has to be masked first. This typically simply involves adding a random number to the value and projecting it onto a fixed set of numbers, a so-called ring. <br>  *masked_value = (private_value - random_numb) % upper absolute value of set of numbers.* For more info on that check out the Udacity Beginner Tutorials by Andrew Trask.

    "# Use-Case: Cifar10 Classification with CNN\n",
    "* To tackle a problem similair to a real-world-problem, yet still using a well explored example (the privacy tools are of main interest in this tutorial) we choose to *train* an Image-Classifier on the **[Cifar-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)** and *do inference* on it. <br>\n",
    "* Containing 60000 32x32 pixels coloured images of 10 different classes (airplanes, birds, etc.) this should showcase a reasonably similair task to other real-world examples such as the training of a classifier for skin-cancer-classification, which heavily relies on sensitive private data. See [Stanford's Skin Cancer Classification with Deep Learning](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/esteva/nature/) for more information on this specific example.\n",
    "* *Specific characteristics:*\n",
    "  * We consider a system of **two** servers as a secure computation unit on which all the computations are conducted in a safe manner. In this case we consider the scenario where two data owners train a model (possibly from a third party) in an encrypted fashion on their respective devices. "

    "### General concept \n",
    "There are two types of SMPC: secret-sharing-based SMPC and circuit-garbling-based SMPC. \n",
    "The two protocols (secureNN and FSS) that are implemented in PySyft to date are both based on the **SPDZ protocol**, \n",
    "which is based on *additive secret-sharing* (the first category) For more information on what *additive secret-sharing* is, check out the tutorials by Andrew Trask as part of the Udacity Private and Secure AI Course.<br>\n",
    "SPDZ is a very widely used protocol for computing linear functions in an encrypted fashion, meaning it can be used to compute sums and multiplication of encrypted variables. The sum of encrypted variables simply consists of each server summing locally its shares of the private variables, which then leads to each server having a share of the sum of the private variables, thus together secret-sharing the sum of the private variables. The multiplication of two encrypted variables however is done using so-called **\"beaver multiplication triples\"** - three randomly generated numbers - which make the encrypted multiplication very efficient compared to other approaches (e.g. garbled circuits).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "*Why more efficient?* See as a brief introduction into this topic the 'Extra: Beaver Multiplication Triples' section or to dig deeper see the resources mentioned just above. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The high-level procedure of SPDZ-based protocols is as follow: (based on the definition from the [Bristol Cryptography Blog](https://bristolcrypto.blogspot.com/2016/10/what-is-spdz-part-1-mpc-circuit.html))\n",
    "   1. Parties secret-share their inputs at the beginning (one crypto-provider exists to generate beaver triples, etc.).\n",
    "   2. Parties compute mul. and sum. locally (using only their share of the private variables). <span style=\"color:red;\">*By design they don't have to communicate with each other while doing the sums locally. Only, in the end, they share their end-result. For multiplication there is one intermediate communication step to exchange hidden shares that are needed for the product to be computed (the exchange of the masked shares, as explained in the next section about Beaver Triples). This reduces communication complexity significantly.*</span> \n",
    "   3. In the end, parties reveal the result of their calculation by sending their share to one server which adds all shares up to unveil the final result. This could be any participating server, or the shares could also be mutually shared with everybody to give any participating server the possibility to decrypt the final result.

    "### Extra: Beaver Multiplication Triples\n",
    "Beaver Triples are simply put randomly generated numbers which are also shared among all different workers and are used to mask (as described above) the input variables to the multiplication so that they can be publicly shared. Then they can be only used to compute the product (the end-result) by simply computing a simple equation out of all masked input variables, which cancels out the random masks and reveals the product. So effectively no further communication between the workers is necessary during the computation itself. Now concerning the overall efficiency of the protocol, you might think that although the communication-complexity is low we still need to generate new Beaver Triples for each multiplication? (because of security issues they can only be used for one multiplication) <br>\n",
    "For this reason, however, the SPDZ protocol is deliberately parted into an 'offline' and an 'online' phase. The 'offline' phase consists of randomly generating all necessary \"crypto-primitives\" - e.g. the Beaver Triples - and can essentially be executed independently of specific inputs of the multiplication, i.e. before the actual multiplications. Thus, given we have generated enough Beaver Triples beforehand, during the 'online' phase we can compute as many multiplications as we have pre-generated Beaver Triples. It has to be noted that we could also generate necessary Beaver Triples during the 'online' phase but that would slow down the computation time for the user waiting for his multiplication to be conducted. The offline phase allows us to shorten this waiting time for the user by generating the triples when no requests are being made. *This makes the SPDZ protocol very efficient for linear computations!*"

    "  * As you probably know in PySyft there exist *worker* objects that have certain default attributes specified and set in `class BaseWorker(AbstractWorker)` ([code](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/blob/c83e615a85bb8944245668d90582fb97c45e6e18/syft/workers/base.py#L48)).

The *crypto_store* object is of type `class PrimitiveStorage`, which specifies a set of given functions that help the respective workers to manage crypto-primitives they need to participate in the respective crypto-protocol. (e.g. Beaver Triples for multiplication in the SPDZ-protocol)\n",

    "Maybe you've read this term a couple of times on the OpenMined workspace or in SMPC-encryption discussions - *on a high-level what is circuit-garbling-based SMPC, or more specifically what are'Garbled Circuits?* <br>\n",
    "Garbled Circuits is a protocol which works as **2-Party-Computation** (i.e. only two servers are involved) The name comes from the method which is used to encrypt a function: a function is represented as a **circuit** consisting of different logical gates (e.g. AND, XOR, etc.). This circuit can be described with a truth-table which indicates at what inputs, what outputs follow. As part of the encryption process, the rows of the truth-table are re-ordered arbitrarily which leads to the name \"garbled\" circuits. <br> \n",
    "The details about the protocol (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbled_circuit) or [this](https://wiki.mpcalliance.org/garbled_circuit.html) comprehensive article from the MPC Wiki) are rather straight forward, the important thing to note is that this technique is **very flexible** as essentially all functions can be encrypted using this method, but also **very inefficient**. That's why often the Garbled Circuits protocol is mainly used on-top of more optimized protocols (such as e.g. SPDZ) to extend the variety of functions compatible with these protocols while not slowing down the computation too much for most computations. <br>\n",
    "It has to be noted that nevertheless, researchers try to find alternative, more efficient protocols that work without Garbled Circuits at the cost of supporting only a lower variety of functions. *Examples for protocols especially for computations that are popular in Machine Learning Models are secureNN and FSS which PySyft supports and over which I'll go over in the following section!* "
