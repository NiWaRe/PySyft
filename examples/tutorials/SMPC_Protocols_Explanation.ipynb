    "# SMPC Protocols Explanation \n",
    "This notebook will give you an overview and a very quick explanation over the different SMPC protocols that are currently implemented in PySyft. It'll also elaborate on **what kind of Machine Learning you can conduct in an encrypted fashion using them**, along a comparison of their resulting performance to each other and to the non-encrypted scenario. The protocol explanations should mainly serve to give you a high-level understanding of what the main **crypto-slang** stands for, how the terms relate to each other and what ressources serve as good starting points to dig deeper! \n",

    "## Quick recap - What is SMPC encryption?\n",
    "As a quick recap \"SMPC\" stands for **Secure Multi-Party Computation** and constitutes a form of encryption which can be used for Machine Learning (i.e. it is possible to do calculations on encrypted data) leveraging a network of min. 2 different servers. These are being trusted of not collaborating with each other and as a whole work as a **trusted execution environment** on which sensitive calculations such as model inference, training, etc. can be done without the model or the data being disclosed to any party besides the respective owner. \n",
    "\n",
    "## General concepts \n",
    "* Important concepts that all protocols are based upon - *in brief:* \n",
    "  * **A Public value,** is considered data (e.g. input from the data-sources) which is known by all parties. \n",
    "  * **A Private value,** is considered data which is secured through additive secret sharing, only the owner knows the true value. \n",
    "  * **Masking:** To share a private value publicily (e.g. as necessary part in a protcol) it has to be masked first. This typically simply involes adding a random number to the value and projecting it onto a fixed set of numbers, a so called ring. <br>  *masked_value = (private_value - random_numb) % upper absolute value of set of numbers.* For more info on that checkout the Udacity Beginner Tutorials by Andrew Trask.

    "There are two types of SMPC: secret-sharing-based SMPC and circuit-gabling-based SMPC. \n",

    "SPDZ is a very widely used protocol for computing linear functions in an encrypted fashion, meaning it can be used to compute sums and multiplication of encrypted variables. <span style=\"color:red;\">The sum of encrypted variables simply consists of each server summing locally its shares of the private variables, which then leads to each server having a share of the sum of the private variables, thus together secret-sharing the sum of the private variables.</span> The multiplication of two encrypted variables however is done using so called **\"beaver multiplication triples\"** - three randomely generated numbers - which make the encrypted multiplication very efficient compared to other appraoches (e.g. garbled circuits)\n",

    "### Extra: Beaver Multiplication Triples\n",
    "Beaver Triples are simply put randomely generated numbers which are also shared among all different workers and are used to mask (as described above) the input variables to the multiplication, so that they can be publicly shared. Then they can be only used to compute the product (the end-result) by simply computing a simple equation out of all masked input variables, which cancels out the random masks and reveals the product. So effectively no further communcations between the workers is necessary during the computation itself. Now concerning the overall efficiency of the protocol you might think that although the communication-complexity is low we still need to generate new Beaver Triples for each multiplication? (because of security issues they can only be used for one multiplication) <br>\n",
    "For this reason however, the SPDZ protocol is parted into an 'offline' and an 'online' phase. The 'offline' phase consists of randomely generating all necessary \"crypto-primitives\" - e.g. the Beaver Triples - and can essentially be executed independently of specific inputs of the multiplication, i.e. before the actual multiplications. Thus, given we have generated enough Beaver Triples beforehand, during the 'online' phase we can compute as much multiplications as we have pre-generated Beaver Triples. *This makes the SPDZ protocol very efficient for linear computations!*"

(e.g. Beaver Triples for multiplication in the SPDZ-protocol)\n",
    "  * Specifically there are two important methods of the crypto_store object.

    "Garbled Circuits is a protocol which works as **2-Party-Computation** (i.e. only two servers are involved) The name comes from the method which is used to encrypt a function: a function is represented as a **circuit** consisting of different logical gates (e.g. AND, XOR, etc.) This circuit can be described with a truthtable which indicates at what inputs, what outputs follow. As part of the encryption process the rows of the truthtable are re-ordered arbitrarily which leads to the name \"garbled\" circuits. <br> \n",
    "The [details about the protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbled_circuit) are rather straight forward, the important thing to note is that this technique is **very flexible** as essentially all functions can be encrypted using this method, but also **very inefficient**. That's why often the Garbled Circuits protocol is mainly used on-top of more optimized protocols (such as e.g. SPDZ) to extend the variety of functions compatible with these protocols while not slowing down the computation too much for most computations. <br>\n",
    "It has to be noted that nevertheless, researchers try to find alternative, more efficient protocols which work withouut Garbled Circuits at the cost of supporting only a lower variety of functions. *Examples for protocols especially for computations that are popular in Machine Learning Models are secureNN and FSS which PySyft supports and over which I'll go over in the following section!*"
